Implemented the coding assignments of the Bioinformatics Specifications (hacker track) availabe on Coursera offered by University of California, San Diego. I passed all six classes with Distinction (all certifications available on https://www.linkedin.com/in/chunyu-zhao-21a1426b).

The Bioinformatics Specifications includes six classes and one Bioinformatics Captone:

Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)

Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)

Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III)

Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics IV)

Genomic Data Science and Clustering (Bioinformatics V)

Finding Mutations in DNA and Proteins (Bioinformatics VI)

Bioinformatics Capstone: Big Data in Biology
